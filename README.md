## Conventions to follow for this project

To be more consistant and productive to our team work in this project we must follow some conventions.

- ### Naming Conventions
 1. Use camelCaseing for

  - ** Blade Files.
  - ** Function Names.
  - ** Variables
 2. Always organise your files in separate folders as needed
 3. Always `git fetch && git pull` before merging any branch into `main`
 4. Always sync your fork before `git fetch && git pull`
 5. Keep your sub-branch up to date by using `git merge main` (if working tree is clean)
 

- ### Resoucre Routes
Resource routes are a very simple way to write clean and consistant routes
```php
Route:resource('user', UserController::class);
```
This single line of code creates 6 general routes that is necessary for CRUD operations
The route names is corresponding to the controllers method names.

- ### Controllers
While resource routes creates a clean and consistant they need some predefined method names to work
So when ever you need a new controller use below command
```bash
php artisan make:controller NameController -r
```
this will create a controller with all the necessarry methods
### Additionally you can create everything you need while creating your Model
```bash
php artisan make:model ModelName -a
```
This command will create Controller, Requests, Migrations and Other files that you may need.


## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
